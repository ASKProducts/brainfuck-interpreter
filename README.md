Brainfuck Interpreter
=====================

A lightweight and fast interpreter for the brainfuck programming language.

This is a small project I started to learn some C.

Building
--------
* cd into the "src" directory
* type "make"
* done :)

Big TODOs
---------
* Interactive mode improvements (see [#1](https://github.com/Kokxx/brainfuck-interpreter/issues/1))
* Compile to c/assembly/machinecode
* Option to enable dynamically sized array (also implement a dynamically sized array)
* more optimizations

Small TODOs
-----------
* Input parameter array size
* Clean up code
* Version string
* Test cases
* Maybe benchmarking options (or any kind of performance test)
* New build system using autotools
* Anything else you can come up with

Contributing

Just send me a pull request, every type of contribution is welcome.
