brainfuck-interpreter
=====================

A lightweight and fast interpreter for the brainfuck programming language.

This is a small project I started to learn some C.

Building
--------
* cd into the "src" directory
* type "make"
* done :)

Big TODOs
---------
* Interactive mode (similar to the cpython interpreter)
* -c option to compile the code
* Option to enable dynamically sized array (also implement a dynamically sized array)

Small TODOs
-----------
* Optimize loop lookup (preferably use a stack data structure instead of O(n) lookup)
* Input parameter array size
* Clean up code
* Version string
* Anything else you can come up with

Contributing
------------
Just send me a pull request, every type of contribution is welcome.
